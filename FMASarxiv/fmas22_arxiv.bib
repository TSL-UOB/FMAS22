	abstract = {The use of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on our streets is soon to be a reality; increasingly, interacting with such AVs will be part of our daily routine. However, we will certainly need to assure the reliable behaviour of an AV, especially when some unexpected scenarios (e.g. harsh environments, obstacles, emergencies) are taken into account. In this article we use an intelligent agent approach to capture the high-level decision-making process within an AV and then use formal verification techniques to automatically, and strongly, analyse the required behaviours. Specifically, we use the MCAPL framework, wherein our core agent is implemented using the GWENDOLEN agent programming language, and to which we can apply model checking via the AJPF model checker. By performing such formal verification on our agent, we are able to prove that the AV’s decision-making process, embedded within the GWENDOLEN agent plans, matches our requirements. As examples, we will verify (formal) properties in order to determine whether the agent behaves in a reliable manner through three different levels of emergency displayed in a simple urban traffic environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Usually, the design of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) does not take into account traffic rules and so the adoption of these rules can bring some challenges, e.g., how to come up with a Digital Highway Code which captures the proper behaviour of an AV against the traffic rules and at the same time minimises changes to the existing Highway Code? Here, we formally model and implement three Road Junction rules (from the UK Highway Code). We use timed automata to model the system and the MCAPL (Model Checking Agent Programming Language) framework to implement an agent and its environment. We also assess the behaviour of our agent according to the Road Junction rules using a double-level Model Checking technique, i.e., UPPAAL at the design level and AJPF (Agent Java PathFinder) at the development level. We have formally verified 30 properties (18 with UPPAAL and 12 with AJPF), where these properties describe the agent’s behaviour against the three Road Junction rules using a simulated traffic scenario, including artefacts like traffic signs and road users. In addition, our approach aims to extract the best from the double-level verification, i.e., using time constraints in UPPAAL timed automata to determine thresholds for the AVs actions and tracing the agent’s behaviour by using MCAPL, in a way that one can tell when and how a given Road Junction rule was selected by the agent. This work provides a proof-of-concept for the formal verification of AV behaviour with respect to traffic rules.},

	abstract = {The design of autonomous vehicles includes obstacle detection and avoidance, route planning, speed control, etc. However, there is a lack of an explicitely representation of the rules of the road on an autonomous vehicle. Additionally, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle in order to check whether or not it works according to the rules of the road. Here, we propose an agent-based architecture to embed the rules of the road into an agent representing the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle. We use temporal logic to formally represent the rules of the road in a way it should be possible to capture when and how a given rule of the road can be applied. Our contributions include: i. suggestion of changes in the rules of the road; ii. representation of rules in a suitable way for an autonomous vehicle agent; iii. dealing with indeterminate terms in the Highway Code.},

One of these stages is to assure the AVs abide by the road traffic rules. To include road traffic rules in the design of an AV, a precise and unambiguous formalisation of these rules is needed. However, only recently this has been pointed out as an issue for the design of AVs and the few works on this only capture the temporal aspects of the rules, leaving behind the spatial aspects. Here, we extend the spatial traffic logic, Urban Multi-lane Spatial Logic, to formalise a subset of the UK road junction rules, where both temporal and spatial aspects of the rules are captured. Our approach has an abstraction level for urban road junctions that could easily promote the formalisation of the whole set of road junction rules and we exemplarily formalise three of the UK road junction rules. Once we have the whole set formalised, we will model, implement, and formally verify the behaviour of an AV against road traffic rules so that guidelines for the creation of a Digital Highway Code for AVs can be established.},
